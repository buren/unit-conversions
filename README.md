# Unit conversions

Simple unit conversions that I often find myself using.

## Supported conversions

- kg to/from lbs (lbs = 0.4536kg)
- mile to/from km
- Running pace min/mile to/from min/km (mile = 1609m)

### TODO

- Celcius to/from Fahrenheit
- Climbing grades
- Height (feet and inches to cm)

## Development

Has no dependencies, requires no build tools and makes no request to any server.

Simply open `index.html` in a browser or serve the static files by running
```
script/server
```
